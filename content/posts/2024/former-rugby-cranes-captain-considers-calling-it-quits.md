The maestro, the conductor, the architect, the 🐐, Captain fantastic and now the
revolutionary. Without mentioning a name, many would know who you’re talking 
about. The journey of this chap starts somewhere along Entebbe Road, onto Masaka
road, then the great school in Seeta before he eventually settles at the sea 
robbers where he currently plys his trade. Many men, let alone boys would only 
dream of half the journey this man has traveled. You could call it “The Journey
less traveled”. Still not sure who the man is? Apologies, I’ll give you a chance
by digging deeper (in the words of the reigning Rugby digital journalist of the
year)

Are leaders born or made? Many believe they’re made. But this lad seems to defy
that school of thought. Where did his stand against injustice start? Well, you 
could trace back to his days in a certain village along Seeta Road. One of his
most loyal soldiers still appears every once in a while in a famous photo (this
loyal soldier was recently interviewed by the fat cats). During that particular
interview, he sung the name of his commander as if a baby crying for a piece of
its mother’s breast. Why? I’ll be keen to find out. I might have a clue, but I
like to hear it straight from the horse’s mouth. The man was given marching 
orders in a match involving Namilyango College and HANA International school. 
And chaos reigned. Ask our 🐐, Philip Wokorach if he finds the fumblers tag fit
for those lads. They surely didn’t fumble that day.

Why is he the centre of focus today? You guessed it right, another ban. The first
one I can remember from my school days was along the same lines “Indiscipline 
and disobeying team instructions” when he was dismissed for a crucial tie against
Tunisia during Big John Duncan’s days (reference Johnson Were’s article on 3 
August, 2018 in the Daily monitor). I don’t believe that was Big John’s call. 
I might be wrong, but I doubt it. At this point, I was myself only a high school
student. A year before, 2017, I had forged a sickness just to be able to leave 
school to watch the legend in his Rasta era. My oh my, what a display he put on.
The Namibians won the war but Ivan Magomu surely lives rent free in their heads.
The Boers will never forget.

The next strike I’m aware of came very recently, sometime last year. I won’t go 
into details. Then the latest of them all, hit only a few hours ago. The man 
cannot seem to leave the eyes of the authorities. Why has this lad been witch 
hunted his whole career? His story is not different from that of the messiah. 
A classic repeat of the Judas Iscariot fiasco. Your own will forsake you. You 
will never be accepted by your own. After the initial statement from the Uganda
Rugby Union last week, many voiced their opinions and many raised eyebrows, even 
those you thought were his comrades.

Uganda rugby might have decided to do way with him for 6 months, but Ivan has 
other ideas. He’s considering making that longer. Speaking to the skipper earlier
this afternoon, he finally seems to have let fate take its path. In his words,
“I told some one that I was the messiah of UG rugby and indeed I’ve been 
crucified and denied by my own. I’ve tried but all they think about is free beer.
SMH. I can nolonger be a part of this metrix bro. Guys are myopic“ Sounds like a
man who has made piece with the system. I also believe this is it for me. Guys 
make it seem like without rugby we cannot live“

History will remember you for walking out the door with a fight. Forever a legend
💪🏿. **LONG LIVE IVAN THE GOAT.**
